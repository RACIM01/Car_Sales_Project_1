This project involves the analysis of car sales announcements obtained through web scraping from Craigslist. The data source is a Kaggle dataset consisting of over 400k rows in a CSV file with a size of 1.45GB.

Key project components include:

1. Analyzing and cleaning data using pandas.
2. Designing and creating a data warehouse using SQL Server 2022.
3. Implementing the Extraction, Transformation, and Load (ETL) process using pandas and sqlalchemy (create_engine, URL), pypyodbc packages.
4. Developing a Power BI Dashboard using the data warehouse.
5. Ongoing work involves creating a machine learning model to predict car prices (to be completed).
